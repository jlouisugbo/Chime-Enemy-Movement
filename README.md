The enemies detection systems.

It's pretty self explanatory. All of the code contains comments that have what the code and design functionality are
The leaper leaps towards the enemy, the stomper slowly stomps towards the enemy (heavy guy)
The ranged enemey is just your normal ranger, the walker is your normal enemy
The dasher dashes towards the target, not deigned if it dashes through or towards yet. And the chaser chases for a certain time before resting.
Enemy.cs also got changed to a protected override void in order to have the enemy classes be able to take the base.Start() from enemy.
